*Health Awareness Dashboard* 

Health Awareness Dashboard

Overview

The *Health Awareness Dashboard* is a simple Python application designed to raise awareness about global health statistics and trends. It focuses on SDG 3: *Good Health and Well-being*, providing users with easy access to health-related data such as vaccination rates, life expectancy, and disease prevalence across different countries. This dashboard allows users to visualize and explore health data interactively.

The project uses Python's data analysis libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`) to load, process, and visualize health data. It is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization concepts.

Features

- Load health data (e.g., vaccination rates, life expectancy) from a CSV file.
- Visualize data using bar charts and other visualizations.
- Allow users to interact with the data by querying specific countries' health statistics.
- Simple, easy-to-understand implementation using Python.

SDG Focus
This project aligns with *Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being*, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. By making health data more accessible, we can better understand global health challenges and work toward achieving the SDGs.

Data Source

The data used in this project can be sourced from publicly available health datasets, such as:
- *[World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/data/gho)*: Global health statistics.
- *[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)*: Datasets on health, life expectancy, disease prevalence, etc.
- *[UNSDG Data](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/)*: Official data for SDG indicators.

In this project, a sample CSV file named `health_data.csv` is used to simulate the health data.
